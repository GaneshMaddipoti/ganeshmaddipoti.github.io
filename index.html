                        <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.               <br/>
                    It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.                        <br/>
                    Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.    <br/>

                    <p>
                        <h5>Kubernetes Cluster</h5>
                    In Kubernetes, a cluster consists of at least one Kubernetes control plane and multiple Kubernetes worker machines called Nodes.            <br/>
                    A cluster is the foundation of Kubernetes: all containerized workloads and services run within a cluster.                                   <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Kubernetes Control Plane</h5>
                    The Kubernetes control plane is responsible for maintaining the desired state for your cluster.                                                                     <br/>
                    When you interact with Kubernetes, such as by using the kubectl command-line interface, you’re communicating with your cluster’s Kubernetes control plane.          <br/>
                    The “control plane” refers to a collection of processes managing the cluster state.                                                                                 <br/>
                    Typically all these processes run on a single node in the cluster, and this node is also referred to as the control plane.                                          <br/>
                    The control plane can also be replicated for availability and redundancy.                                                                                           <br/>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Kubernetes Nodes</h5>
                    The nodes in a cluster are the machines (VMs, physical servers, etc) that run your applications and containerized workflows.        <br/>
                    The Kubernetes control plane controls each node; you’ll rarely interact with nodes directly.                                        <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Container Registry</h5>
                    A Container Registry is a single access point to manage Container Images.                                                                                           <br/>
                    Container Images are stored with rich metadata that allows images to be searched, viewed and retrieved for deployment to Container Platforms such as Kubernetes.    <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Namespace</h5>
                    Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects.                                                                                                  <br/>
                    Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users. In GKP, namespaces are segmented by SEAL applications and deployments (a single SEAL application can have multiple deployments).   <br/>

                        <h5>Introduction</h5>
                        • Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications.                                                 <br/>
                        • Docker enable you to separate your applications from infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.                      <br/>
                        • With Docker, you can manager your infrastructure the same way you manager your applications.                                  <br/>
                        • By using Docker methodologies, we can significantly reduce the delay between development and running in production.           <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker Platform</h5>
                        • Docker provides the ability to package and run application, in a loosely isolated environment called container.               <br/>
                        • Containers are light weight, self-contained, sharable, so scalable, and can run in different host environments.               <br/>
                        • Docker provides the tooling and platform to manage the lifecycle of containers.                                               <br/>
                        a. Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.                                                     <br/>
                        b. It becomes the unit, distributable, testable and scalable.                                                                   <br/>
                        c. Once development is ready, deploy it to different environments without any changes.                                          <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Use cases</h5>
                        • Fast, consistent delivery of applications.                                                                                    <br/>
                        • Responsive deployment and scalable                                                                                            <br/>
                        • Running more workloads on same h/w                                                                                            <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker Architecture</h5>                        •
                        • Docker uses client-server architecture, where docker client talks to docker domain using REST API over UNIX sockets or n/w interface. <br/>
                        • Another docker client is Docker compose, which lets you work with applications consisting of set of containers.               <br/>

                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker Daemon</h5>
                        ○ Docker Daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and managers Docker objects such as images, containers, n/w and volumes. <br/>
                        ○ A Daemon can communicate with other daemons to manage docker services.                                                            <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker Client</h5>
                        ○ Docker Client (docker) is the primary way that many docker users interact with Docker.                                        <br/>
                        ○ When you run commands like docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd for execution.                              <br/>
                        ○ The docker command uses the docker API                                                                                        <br/>
                        ○ The Docker client can communicate with multiple daemons.                                                                      <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker Desktop</h5>
                        ○ Docker desktop is easy to install application for MAC, Windows and Linux environments.                                        <br/>
                        ○ It enables you to build and share containerize applications and micro services.                                               <br/>
                        ○ It includes docker, dockerd, docker compose, docker content trust, Kubernetes, and credential helper.                         <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker registries</h5>
                        ○ A docker registry stores docker images.                                                                                       <br/>
                        ○ Docker is public registry and default when you pull.                                                                          <br/>
                        ○ We can even run our own private registry.                                                                                     <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Docker Objects (Images, Containers, Networks, Volumes, Plugins, and other)</h5>
                        Image
                        ○ An image is read only template used to materialize the container.                                                             <br/>
                        ○ To build an image, we write Dockerfile with simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create an image.                   <br/>
                        ○ Each instruction creates a layer in the image.                                                                                <br/>
                        ○ When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which are changed are rebuild.                        <br/>
                        Container
                        ○ Container is runnable instance of Image.                                                                                      <br/>
                        ○ We can create, start, stop, move and delete a container using Docker API or CLI.                                              <br/>
                        ○ We can connect a container to more than one networks, attach storage to it, or even create image with current state.          <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Underlying technology</h5>
                        • Docker is written in Go Programming language.                                                                                 <br/>
                        • Docker uses namespaces to provide isolated workspaces called containers.                                                      <br/>

                        Linux originated from Unix, which is leading operating system in 1970 - 1990.                                                       <br/>
                        When Unix became commercial, the counter movement for free software foundation started, and Linux fits here.                        <br/>
                        Also GNU, GNU is a free and open-source operating system, the mission is to use free tools for Unix.                                <br/>
                        In 1992, Linus Torvalds added Linux kernel to GNU, that completes GNU system.                                                       <br/>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Operating System</h2>
                    <p><h5>Introduction</h5>
                    An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.    <br/>
                    The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API).                                <br/>
                    In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).                    <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p><h5>Why use an operating system?</h5>
                    An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development.                                                                                             <br/>
                    Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying H/W.  <br/>
                    Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware.  <br/>
                    The system software provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.    <br/>
                    Once installed, the operating system relies on a vast library of device drivers to tailor OS services to the specific hardware environment.                                             <br/>
                    Thus, every application may make a common call to a storage device, but the OS receives that call and uses the corresponding driver to translate the call into actions (commands)
                    needed for the underlying hardware on that specific computer.                                                                                                                           <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p><h5>What are the functions of an operating system?</h5>
                    An operating system provides three essential capabilities:                                                                      <br/>
                    1. It offers a UI through a CLI or GUI;                                                                                         <br/>
                    2. It launches and manages the application execution;                                                                           <br/>
                    3. It identifies and exposes system hardware resources to those applications -- typically, through a standardized API.          <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p><h5>Additionally, an operating system can perform the following services for applications:</h5>
                    In a multitasking operating system, where multiple programs can be running at the same time, the OS do multi-tasking/ multi-threading.                              <br/>
                    It handles input/output (I/O) to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers and dial-up ports. (Device management)                            <br/>
                    It sends messages to each application or interactive user -- or to a system operator -- about the status of operation and any errors that may have occurred.        <br/>
                    It can offload the management of batch jobs -- for example, printing -- so that the initiating application is freed from this work.                                 <br/>
                    On computers that can provide parallel processing, an operating system can manage how to divide the program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.   <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p><h5>Kernel</h5>
                    The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system.                     <br/>
                    It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.             <br/>
                    A full kernel controls all hardware resources (e.g. I/O, memory, cryptography) via device drivers, arbitrates conflicts between processes concerning such resources,
                    nd optimizes the utilization of common resources e.g. CPU & cache usage, file systems, and network sockets.                                                         <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p><h5>Functionalities provided by OS</h5>
                    1. Process management   <br/>
                    2. Memory management    <br/>
                    3. Device management    <br/>
                    4. Network management   <br/>
                    5. Security             <br/>

                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    Computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. <br/>
                    Hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), Input/Output devices and motherboard. <br/>
                    Software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. <br/>
                    Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change. <br/>
                    Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction, this combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Von Neumann architecture</h5>
                    The template for all modern computers is the Von Neumann architecture, detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. <br/>
                    This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers,
                    a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms. <br/><br/>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Input device</h5>
                    Input devices allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. <br/>
                    Most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard, but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse. <br/>
                    Other input devices include webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Output device</h5>
                    Output devices are designed around the senses of human beings. <br/>
                    For example, monitors display text that can be read, speakers produce sound that can be heard. Such devices also could include printers or a Braille embosser. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Storage devices</h5>
                    A storage device is any computing hardware and digital media that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. <br/>
                    It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. <br/>
                    Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers. Dedicated storage devices include RAIDs and tape libraries. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Fixed media</h5>
                    Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media. <br/>
                    Hard disk drives (HDDs) are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but solid-state drives (SSDs) are faster and more power efficient. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Removable media</h5>
                    To transfer data between computers, an external flash memory device (such as a memory card or USB flash drive) or optical disc (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or BD-ROM) may be used. <br/>
                    The majority of machines have an optical disk drive (ODD), and virtually all have at least one Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. <br/>
                    Additionally, USB sticks are typically pre-formatted with the FAT32 file system, which is widely supported across operating systems. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Motherboard</h5>
                    The motherboard is the main component of a computer. <br/>
                    It is a board with integrated circuitry that connects the other parts of the computer including the CPU, the RAM, the disk drives (CD, DVD, hard disk, or any others)
                    as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots. <br/>
                    The integrated circuit (IC) chips in a computer typically contain billions of tiny metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). <br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Components directly attached to or to part of the motherboard include</h5>
                    CPU (central processing unit), which performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is referred to as the brain of the computer. <br/>
                    It takes program instructions from RAM, interprets and processes them and then sends back results so that the relevant components can carry out the instructions. <br/>
                    The CPU is a microprocessor, which is fabricated on a metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. <br/>
                    It is usually cooled by a heatsink and fan, or water-cooling system. Many newer CPUs include an on-die graphics processing unit (GPU). <br/>
                    The clock speed of the CPU governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1 GHz and 5 GHz. <br/>
                    Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling. <br/><br/>

                    The chipset, which includes the north bridge, mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory;
                    as well as south bridge, which is connected to the north bridge, and supports auxiliary interfaces and buses; and, finally, a Super I/O chip,
                    connected through the south bridge, which supports the slowest and most legacy components like serial ports, hardware monitoring and fan control. <br/><br/>

                    Random-access memory (RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. <br/>
                    For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. <br/>
                    It is typically a type of dynamic RAM (DRAM), such as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), where MOS memory chips store data on memory cells consisting of MOSFETs and MOS capacitors. <br/>
                    RAM usually comes on dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) in the sizes of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger. <br/><br/>

                    Read-only memory (ROM), which stores the BIOS that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as Bootstrapping,
                    or "booting" or "booting up". The ROM is typically a non-volatile BIOS memory chip, which stores data on floating-gate MOSFET memory cells. <br/>
                    The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) includes boot firmware and power management firmware. <br/>
                    Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS. <br/><br/>

                    Buses that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.<br/><br/>

                    The CMOS (complementary MOS) battery, which powers the CMOS memory for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a watch battery. <br/><br/>

                    The video card (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks,
                    such as playing intensive video games or running computer graphics software. A video card contains a graphics processing unit (GPU)
                    and video memory (typically a type of SDRAM), both fabricated on MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) chips.<br/><br/>

                    Power MOSFETs make up the voltage regulator module (VRM), which controls how much voltage other hardware components receive. <br/>
