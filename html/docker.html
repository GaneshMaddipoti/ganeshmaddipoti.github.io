<p>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
• Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications.                                                 <br/>
• Docker enable you to separate your applications from infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.                      <br/>
• With Docker, you can manager your infrastructure the same way you manager your applications.                                  <br/>
• By using Docker methodologies, we can significantly reduce the delay between development and running in production.           <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Docker Platform</h5>
• Docker provides the ability to package and run application, in a loosely isolated environment called container.               <br/>
• Containers are light weight, self-contained, sharable, so scalable, and can run in different host environments.               <br/>
• Docker provides the tooling and platform to manage the lifecycle of containers.                                               <br/>
a. Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.                                                     <br/>
b. It becomes the unit, distributable, testable and scalable.                                                                   <br/>
c. Once development is ready, deploy it to different environments without any changes.                                          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Use cases</h5>
• Fast, consistent delivery of applications.                                                                                    <br/>
• Responsive deployment and scalable                                                                                            <br/>
• Running more workloads on same h/w                                                                                            <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Docker Architecture</h5>                        •
• Docker uses client-server architecture, where docker client talks to docker domain using REST API over UNIX sockets or n/w interface. <br/>
• Another docker client is Docker compose, which lets you work with applications consisting of set of containers.               <br/>

<h5>Docker Daemon</h5>
○ Docker Daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and managers Docker objects such as images, containers, n/w and volumes. <br/>
○ A Daemon can communicate with other daemons to manage docker services.                                                            <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Docker Client</h5>
○ Docker Client (docker) is the primary way that many docker users interact with Docker.                                        <br/>
○ When you run commands like docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd for execution.                              <br/>
○ The docker command uses the docker API                                                                                        <br/>
○ The Docker client can communicate with multiple daemons.                                                                      <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Docker Desktop</h5>
○ Docker desktop is easy to install application for MAC, Windows and Linux environments.                                        <br/>
○ It enables you to build and share containerize applications and micro services.                                               <br/>
○ It includes docker, dockerd, docker compose, docker content trust, Kubernetes, and credential helper.                         <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Docker registries</h5>
○ A docker registry stores docker images.                                                                                       <br/>
○ Docker is public registry and default when you pull.                                                                          <br/>
○ We can even run our own private registry.                                                                                     <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Docker Objects (Images, Containers, Networks, Volumes, Plugins, and other)</h5>
Image
○ An image is read only template used to materialize the container.                                                             <br/>
○ To build an image, we write Dockerfile with simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create an image.                   <br/>
○ Each instruction creates a layer in the image.                                                                                <br/>
○ When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which are changed are rebuild.                        <br/>
Container
○ Container is runnable instance of Image.                                                                                      <br/>
○ We can create, start, stop, move and delete a container using Docker API or CLI.                                              <br/>
○ We can connect a container to more than one networks, attach storage to it, or even create image with current state.          <br/>

<h5>Underlying technology</h5>
• Docker is written in Go Programming language.                                                                                 <br/>
• Docker uses namespaces to provide isolated workspaces called containers.                                                      <br/>
