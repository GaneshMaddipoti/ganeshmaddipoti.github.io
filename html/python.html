            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>
            <h6>Introduction</h6>
            Python is a modern high-level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum in the 1990s.              <br/>

            <h6>Do well</h6>                                                                                            <br/>
            Its cross-platform, interpreted, open source.                                                               <br/>
            It's easy to use (Dynamically typed, abstracted, indented)                                                  <br/>
            It's used for rapid application development (as coding time is very less compared to others)                <br/>
            Its expressive (A single line will do more things)                                                          <br/>
            Its readable (as its indented very well)                                                                    <br/>
            Its batter included philosophy, meaning standard library comes with email, web, DB, GUI, etc...             <br/>

            <h6>Doesn't do well</h6>
            Its speed of execution is slow (as its interpreted after semi-compiled)                                     <br/>
            It doesn't have the most of the libraries.                                                                  <br/>
            It doesn't check variable type at compile time, leads to runtime errors.                                    <br/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item">
            <h6>Syntax</h6>
            Built-in data types : Integers, Floats, Complex numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and File Objects.      <br/>
            These can be manipulated using language operators, builtin functions, library functions, and data type's own methods. <br/>
            Programmers also can create their own classes and instantiate objects.                                                <br/>
            All python objects are instances of one class or the other.                                                           <br/>
            if-elseif-else - conditional loop and for, while -> iterative loops.                                                  <br/>
            It allows function definition with flexible argument-passing options.                                                 <br/>
            Exceptions(errors) can be raised using raise statement, and handled by try-except-else construct.                     <br/>
            Variables dont have to be declared, can have any build-in data type, user defined object, function or module.         <br/>
            We can use \ to break a long statement across multiple lines.                                                         <br/>

            <h6>Built-in Data types</h6>
            Numbers                                                                                                     <br/>
            Integers - -999999999 0 +999999999999                                                                       <br/>
            Floats - -9.99 0.0 +9.9                                                                                     <br/>
            Complex numbers - 3+2j -4.2-6.3j                                                                            <br/>
            Booleans - True(1) False(0)                                                                                 <br/>
            We can manipulate them using arithmetic operators. (+, -, *, /, **, %)                                      <br/>
            Note that, integers are of unlimited size, they will grow as large as you need them do.                     <br/>
            Complex numbers consist of both real and imaginary elements, we can get by using x.real.                    <br/>

            <h6>Lists</h6>
            A list can contain a mixture of other types as elements (Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and File objects)   <br/>
            Ex: [1,2,"three", 3L, 4.0, ["a", "b"], (5,6)]                                                                               <br/>
            Lists can be indexed from its front(0 to length-1) or back(-1 to -length).                                                  <br/>
            We can obtain a slice using [m:n] where m is the inclusive starting index and n is exclusive ending index.                  <br/>
            The size of the list increases or decreases, if the new slice is bigger or smaller than the slice its replacing.            <br/>
            The operators +, * will create new list, leaving the original unchanged.                                                    <br/>

            <h6>Tuples</h6>
            The are like lists, except they are immutable.                                                                          <br/>
            Can contain a mixture of other types as elements (Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and File objects)      <br/>
            Ex: (1,2,"three", 3L, 4.0, ["a", "b"], (5,6))                                                                           <br/>
            A one element needs a comma.                                                                                            <br/>

            <h6>Strings</h6>
            String are sequence of characters, delimited by ', ", """, ''' quotations and can contain \t and \n characters.         <br/>
            Strings are immutable.                                                                                                  <br/>
            re module provides regular expression functionality, have pattern extraction and replacement capability.                <br/>

            <h6>Dictionaries</h6>
            It like associative array functionality, implemented using hash tables.                                     <br/>
            Ex: {1: "one", 2: "tow", 3: "three"}                                                                        <br/>
            Keys must be an immutable type.                                                                             <br/>
            Values can be any kind of objects including mutable objects lists, and dictionaries.                        <br/>

            <h6>Sets</h6>
            Its an unordered collection of objects with membership, uniqueness in its features.                         <br/>

            <h6>File Objects</h6>
            A file in system, is accessed by file object in Python.                                                     <br/>
            The os module provides number of functions over files and directories in that system.                       <br/>

            <h6>Operators</h6>
            Arithmetic : +, -, *, /, //, **, %                                                                          <br/>
            Comparison : <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, is, is not, in, not in results boolean                                   <br/>
            Logical : and, not, or results boolean                                                                      <br/>

            <h6>Expressions</h6>
            Division of integers with single /, will result float, with // will result truncated integer.               <br/>
            if: elseif: else: conditional expression                                                                    <br/>
            <pre>
                x = 28
                if x < 0:
                    print('x < 0')                     # Executes only if x < 0
                elif x == 1:
                    print('x == 1')                    # If it's not true that x < 0 and x != 0, check if x == 1
                else:
                    print('none of the above is true')
            </pre>
            <h6>Loops</h6>
            while: for: iterative statement                                                                             <br/>
            <pre>
                starting_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
                for i in starting_numbers:
                    print(i)

                square = 1
                while square <= 10:
                    print(square)
                    square += 1
            </pre>

            <h6>Functions</h6>
            Functions are defined by using the def statement.                                                           <br/>
            The return statement is what a function uses to return a value.                                             <br/>
            The return type can be of any type.                                                                         <br/>
            If no return statement is encountered, python's None value is returned.                                     <br/>
            Function arguments can be entered either by position or name.                                               <br/>
            Function parameters can be defined with defaults.                                                           <br/>
            A special parameter can be defined to collect all extra arguments into a tuple, or dictionary.              <br/>
            <pre>
                def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
                    return a + b
            </pre>

            <h6>Exceptions</h6>
            Exceptions(errors) can be raised, caght, and handled by try-except-finally-else compound statement.         <br/>

            <h6>Modules and Packages</h6>
            Modules is used to define functions at one place and use them in multiple places                            <br/>
            Group of modules, we organize them using packages, subpackages.                                             <br/>

            <h6>Object Oriented Programming</h6>
            Classes are defined using Class keyword.                                                                    <br/>
            The instance initializer method or constructor is defined as __init__ method, and will be called implicitly.<br/>
            The first argument of any method is by convention called self.                                              <br/>
            The print method implicitly uses __str__ method.                                                            <br/>
            <pre>
                class Cat:
                    count = 0                           //class variable
                    def __init__(self, name):           //instance variable
                        self.name = name
                    def incrementCount():
                        count++;
            </pre>

            <h6>Programming</h6>
            Indentation and block structuring                                                                           <br/>
            Python doesn't use braces to indicate code structure, rather uses indentation itself is used.               <br/>

            <h6>Variables and Assignments</h6>
            x = 5                                                                                                       <br/>
            In Python, neither a variable type declaration nor end of the line delimiter is required.                   <br/>
            Variable names are case-sensitive, and can contain alphanumeric and underscore, usually start with letter or underscore. <br/>
