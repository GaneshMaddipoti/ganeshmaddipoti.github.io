<h3 class="mb-5">Operating System</h3>
<p><h6>Introduction</h6>
An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.    <br/>
The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API).                                <br/>
In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).                    <br/>

<p><h6>Why use an operating system?</h6>
An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development.                                                                                             <br/>
Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying H/W.  <br/>
Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware.  <br/>
The system software provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.    <br/>
Once installed, the operating system relies on a vast library of device drivers to tailor OS services to the specific hardware environment.                                             <br/>
Thus, every application may make a common call to a storage device, but the OS receives that call and uses the corresponding driver to translate the call into actions (commands)
needed for the underlying hardware on that specific computer.                                                                                                                           <br/>

<p><h6>What are the functions of an operating system?</h6>
An operating system provides three essential capabilities:                                                                      <br/>
1. It offers a UI through a CLI or GUI;                                                                                         <br/>
2. It launches and manages the application execution;                                                                           <br/>
3. It identifies and exposes system hardware resources to those applications -- typically, through a standardized API.          <br/>
</p>
<p><h6>Additionally, an operating system can perform the following services for applications:</h6>
In a multitasking operating system, where multiple programs can be running at the same time, the OS do multi-tasking/ multi-threading.                              <br/>
It handles input/output (I/O) to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers and dial-up ports. (Device management)                            <br/>
It sends messages to each application or interactive user -- or to a system operator -- about the status of operation and any errors that may have occurred.        <br/>
It can offload the management of batch jobs -- for example, printing -- so that the initiating application is freed from this work.                                 <br/>
On computers that can provide parallel processing, an operating system can manage how to divide the program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.   <br/>
</p>
<p><h6>Kernel</h6>
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system.                     <br/>
It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.             <br/>
A full kernel controls all hardware resources (e.g. I/O, memory, cryptography) via device drivers, arbitrates conflicts between processes concerning such resources,
nd optimizes the utilization of common resources e.g. CPU & cache usage, file systems, and network sockets.                                                         <br/>
</p>
<p><h6>Functionalities provided by OS</h6>
1. Process management   <br/>
2. Memory management    <br/>
3. Device management    <br/>
4. Network management   <br/>
5. Security             <br/>
