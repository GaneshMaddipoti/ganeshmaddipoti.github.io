    In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.               <br/>
    A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.                                               <br/>
    For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video.                               <br/>
    The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.                                        <br/>

<h6>Cloud Computing</h6>
<p>
    On demand delivery of IT resources (Infrastructure, Platform, Network, Storage, Applications, etc..) over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.  <br/>

<h6>Deployment models for cloud computing</h6>
<p>
    Cloud-based deployment model                                                                           <br/>
     - Run all parts of the application in the cloud.                                                      <br/>
     - Migrate existing applications to the cloud.                                                         <br/>
     - Design and build new applications in the cloud.                                                     <br/>
</p>
<p>
    On-premises deployment                                                                                  <br/>
     - Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.                              <br/>
     - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.       <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Hybrid deployment                                                                                       <br/>
     - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.                                         <br/>
     - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.                                         <br/>
