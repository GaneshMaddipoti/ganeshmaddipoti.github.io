            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                Java was conceived by james gosling and his team at sun micro systems in 1991.                                      <br/>
                This language was initially called “OAK” , but was renamed to “JAVA” in 1995.                                       <br/>
                Java derives much of the syntax from ‘C’ and ‘C++’.                                                                 <br/>
                Translating a java program into byte code helps makes it much easier to run a program in a wide variety of environments, <br/>
                the reason is, only the JVM need to implemented for each platform.                                                  <br/>
                The details of jvm differ from platform-to-platform.                                                                <br/>
