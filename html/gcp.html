<h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology created the term cloud computing.
<p>
  Historically, data centers have been kept and managed in a physical state from one central location;                  <br/>
  however, an increased demand for flexible IT solutions have led to emergent technologies that literally transform the traditional data center.  <br/>

The trend towards cloud computing started with
  Wave 1: Co-location                                                                                                     <br/>
          Gave users the financial efficiency of renting physical space, instead of investing in data center real estate. <br/>
          A co-location facility, or colo, is a data center facility in which a business can rent space for servers and other computing hardware. <br/>
          Typically, a colo provides the building, cooling, power, bandwidth and physical security, while the customer provides servers and storage. <br/>
  <br/>
  wave 2: Virtualized data centers                                                                                      <br/>
  The components of these match the physical building blocks of hosted computing—servers, CPUs, disks, load balancers, and so on—but now they’re virtual devices. <br/>
  The process abstracts physical hardware by mimicking its processors, operating system, and other resources with help from a hypervisor. <br/>
  With virtualization, enterprises still maintain the infrastructure; but it also remains a user-controlled and user-configured environment. <br/>
  <br/>
  Wave 3: Cloud Computing
  It is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits            <br/>
  1. customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.                                             <br/>
  2. customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection.                   <br/>
  3. the cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool.                 <br/>
  4. the resources are elastic–which means they’re flexible, so customers can be. If they need more resources they can get more, and quickly.   <br/>
  5. customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.       <br/>

<h6>GCP</h6>
<p>
  Google Cloud is a suite of cloud services hosted on Google's infrastructure.                                                                        <br/>
  From computing and storage, to data analytics, machine learning, and networking, Google Cloud offers a wide variety of services                     <br/>
  and APIs that can be integrated with any cloud-computing application or project, from personal to enterprise-grade.                                 <br/>
  Google Cloud offerings can be broadly categorised as Compute storage Big data Machine learning and application services for web, mobile, analytics, and back-end solutions. <br/>
  <img src="assets/img/gcp-services.PNG" class="img-fluid"/>                                                                                          <br/>
  Cloud Console—an in-browser UI that lets you access and manage Google Cloud services.                                                               <br/>

  Organizations use Google Cloud in different ways, so projects are a good method for organizing cloud computing services (team, product, for example.) <br/>

  A Google Cloud project is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often contains resources and services;                           <br/>
  for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them together.                                 <br/>
  Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources.                                  <br/>
  A Project ID is a unique identifier that is used to link Google Cloud resources and APIs to your specific project.                                  <br/>
  Project IDs are unique across Google Cloud: there can be only one qwiklabs-gcp-xxx...., which makes it globally identifiable.                       <br/>
</p>

<h6>Roles</h6>
<p>
  In addition to cloud computing services, Google Cloud also contains a collection of permissions and roles that define who has access to what resources. <br/>
  You can use the Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) service to inspect and modify these roles and permissions.                         <br/>
  Basic roles set project-level permissions and, unless otherwise specified, control access and management to all Google Cloud services.              <br/>
  Role Name	      Permissions                                                                                                                         <br/>
  roles/viewer	  Permissions for read-only actions that do not affect state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.         <br/>
  roles/editor	  All viewer permissions, plus permissions for actions that modify state, such as changing existing resources.                        <br/>
  roles/owner	  All editor permissions and permissions for the following actions: billing, manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project; <br/>
</p>

<h6>APIs and services</h6>
<p>
  Google Cloud APIs are a key part of Google Cloud. Like services, the 200+ APIs, in areas that range from business administration to machine learning, <br/>
  all easily integrate with Google Cloud projects and applications.                                                                                     <br/>
  APIs are application programming interfaces that you can call directly or via the client libraries.                                                 <br/>
  Cloud APIs use resource-oriented design principles                                                                                                  <br/>
