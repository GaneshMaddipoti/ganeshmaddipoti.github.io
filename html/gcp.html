      <p>
        Container-based architecture—a fully automated, elastic third-wave cloud that consists of a combination of automated services and scalable data.    <br/>
        Services automatically provision and configure the infrastructure used to run applications.                                                         <br/>
        In the future, every company—regardless of size or industry— will differentiate itself from its competitors through technology.                     <br/>
        Increasingly, that technology will be in the form of software.                                                                                      <br/>
        Great software is based on high-quality data. This means that every company is, or will eventually become, a data company.                          <br/>

        Each of these locations is divided into several regions and zones.                                                                                  <br/>
        Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones. For example, London, or europe-west2, is a region that currently comprises three different zones. <br/>
        A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.                                                                                        <br/>
        For example, if you launch a virtual machine using Compute Engine it will run in the zones that you specify to ensure resource redundancy.          <br/>
        You can also run resources in different regions.                                                                                                    <br/>

      <h6>Introduction</h6>
      <p>
        Google Cloud is a suite of cloud services hosted on Google's infrastructure.                                                                        <br/>
        From computing and storage, to data analytics, machine learning, and networking, Google Cloud offers a wide variety of services                     <br/>

        and APIs that can be integrated with any cloud-computing application or project, from personal to enterprise-grade.                                 <br/>
        Cloud Console—an in-browser UI that lets you access and manage Google Cloud services.                                                               <br/>

        Organizations use Google Cloud in different ways, so projects are a good method for organizing cloud computing services (team, product, for example.) <br/>

        A Google Cloud project is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often contains resources and services;                           <br/>
        for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them together.                                 <br/>
        Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources.                                  <br/>
        A Project ID is a unique identifier that is used to link Google Cloud resources and APIs to your specific project.                                  <br/>
        Project IDs are unique across Google Cloud: there can be only one qwiklabs-gcp-xxx...., which makes it globally identifiable.                       <br/>
      </p>

      <h6>Roles</h6>
      <p>
        In addition to cloud computing services, Google Cloud also contains a collection of permissions and roles that define who has access to what resources. <br/>
        You can use the Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) service to inspect and modify these roles and permissions.                         <br/>
        Basic roles set project-level permissions and, unless otherwise specified, control access and management to all Google Cloud services.              <br/>
        Role Name	      Permissions                                                                                                                         <br/>
        roles/viewer	  Permissions for read-only actions that do not affect state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.         <br/>
        roles/editor	  All viewer permissions, plus permissions for actions that modify state, such as changing existing resources.                        <br/>
        roles/owner	  All editor permissions and permissions for the following actions: billing, manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project; <br/>
      </p>

      <h6>APIs and services</h6>
      <p>
        Google Cloud APIs are a key part of Google Cloud. Like services, the 200+ APIs, in areas that range from business administration to machine learning, <br/>
        all easily integrate with Google Cloud projects and applications.                                                                                     <br/>
        APIs are application programming interfaces that you can call directly or via the client libraries.                                                 <br/>
        Cloud APIs use resource-oriented design principles                                                                                                  <br/>

      </p>

      <h6>Pricing</h6>
      <p>
        Google was the first major cloud provider to deliver per-second billing for its infrastructure-as-a-service compute offering, Compute Engine.       <br/>
        In addition, per-second billing is now also offered for Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, and App Engine flexible environment VMs                 <br/>

      <h6>Google Cloud Resource Hierarchy</h6>
      <p>
        Google Cloud’s resource hierarchy contains four levels, they are: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node.                     <br/>
        <img src="assets/img/gcp-resource-hierarchy.PNG" class="img-fluid"/>                                                                          <br/>
        Resources - These represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud.                    <br/>
        Resources are organized into projects.                                                                                                        <br/>
        Projects can be organized into folders, or even sub-folders.                                                                                   <br/>
        Organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization.                                           <br/>
        It’s important to understand this resource hierarchy because it directly relates to how policies are managed and applied in Google Cloud.     <br/>
        Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels, and can be applied to some individual resources, too.           <br/>
        Policies are also inherited downward. This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all the projects within that folder. <br/>
        Projects are the basis for enabling and using Google Cloud services, like managing APIs, enabling billing, and enabling other Google services. <br/>
        Each Google Cloud project has three identifying attributes: a project ID, a project name, and a project number.                               <br/>
        <br/>
        The project ID is a globally unique identifier assigned by Google that can’t be changed after creation. (Immutable)                           <br/>
        Project IDs are used in different contexts to inform Google Cloud of the exact project to work with.                                          <br/>
        Project names, however, are user-created. They don’t have to be unique and they can be changed at any time, so they are not immutable.        <br/>
        Google Cloud also assigns each project a unique project number. they’re mainly used internally by Google Cloud to keep track of resources.    <br/>
        <br/>
        Google Cloud’s Resource Manager tool is designed to programmatically help you manage projects.                                                <br/>
        It’s an API that can gather a list of projects associated with an account, create new projects, update existing projects, and delete projects.<br/>
        It can even recover projects that were previously deleted,and can be accessed through the RPC API and the REST API.                           <br/>
        <br/>
        Folders let you assign policies to resources at a level of granularity you choose.                                                            <br/>
        The resources in a folder inherit policies and permissions assigned to that folder.                                                           <br/>
        A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both.                                                                       <br/>
        You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. (Ex: per department, vertical, etc...)                            <br/>
        To use folders, you must have an organization node, which is the very topmost resource in the Google Cloud hierarchy.                         <br/>
        Everything else attached to that account goes under this node, which includes folders, projects, and other resources.                         <br/>

        If you have a Workspace domain, Google Cloud projects will automatically belong to your organization node.                                    <br/>
        Otherwise, you can use Cloud Identity, Google’s identity, access, application, and endpoint management platform, to generate one.             <br/>
