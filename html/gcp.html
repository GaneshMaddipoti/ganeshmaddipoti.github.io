<h3>GCP</h3>

<h6>Introduction</h6>
<p>
  Google Cloud is a suite of cloud services hosted on Google's infrastructure.                                                                        <br/>
  From computing and storage, to data analytics, machine learning, and networking, Google Cloud offers a wide variety of services                     <br/>

  and APIs that can be integrated with any cloud-computing application or project, from personal to enterprise-grade.                                 <br/>
  Cloud Consoleâ€”an in-browser UI that lets you access and manage Google Cloud services.                                                               <br/>

  Organizations use Google Cloud in different ways, so projects are a good method for organizing cloud computing services (team, product, for example.) <br/>

  A Google Cloud project is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often contains resources and services;                           <br/>
  for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them together.                                 <br/>
  Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources.                                  <br/>
  A Project ID is a unique identifier that is used to link Google Cloud resources and APIs to your specific project.                                  <br/>
  Project IDs are unique across Google Cloud: there can be only one qwiklabs-gcp-xxx...., which makes it globally identifiable.                       <br/>
</p>

<h6>Roles</h6>
<p>
  In addition to cloud computing services, Google Cloud also contains a collection of permissions and roles that define who has access to what resources. <br/>
  You can use the Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) service to inspect and modify these roles and permissions.                         <br/>
  Basic roles set project-level permissions and, unless otherwise specified, control access and management to all Google Cloud services.              <br/>
  Role Name	      Permissions                                                                                                                         <br/>
  roles/viewer	  Permissions for read-only actions that do not affect state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.         <br/>
  roles/editor	  All viewer permissions, plus permissions for actions that modify state, such as changing existing resources.                        <br/>
  roles/owner	  All editor permissions and permissions for the following actions: billing, manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project; <br/>
</p>

<h6>APIs and services</h6>
<p>
  Google Cloud APIs are a key part of Google Cloud. Like services, the 200+ APIs, in areas that range from business administration to machine learning, <br/>
  all easily integrate with Google Cloud projects and applications.                                                                                     <br/>
  APIs are application programming interfaces that you can call directly or via the client libraries.                                                 <br/>
  Cloud APIs use resource-oriented design principles                                                                                                  <br/>
