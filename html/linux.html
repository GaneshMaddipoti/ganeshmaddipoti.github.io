  About
  It's between applications and hardware, manage storage, memory, files, GUI, CLI, networking, Utilities, drivers, security, users
  Linux originated from Unix, which is leading operating system in 1970 - 1990.
  When Unix became commercial, the counter movement for free software foundation started, and Linux fits here.
  Also GNU, GNU is a free and open-source operating system, the mission is to use free tools for Unix.
  In 1992, Linus Torvalds added Linux kernel to GNU, that completes GNU system.

  Distributions
  Debian - Ubuntu, Mint, Kali
  Redhat - CentOS, Fedora
  SUSE - OpenSUSE
  Arch Linux - LinHES, Manjaro

  Layers of Linux
  Kernel - Handles system hardware resources on behalf of the OS user. (using libraries in glibc)
  ○ User interacts with kernel/glibc using shell.
  ○ Services interacts with with kernel/glibc using systemd
  Desktop - Software designed to manage GUI
  Custom Tools - provided by specific Linux distribution (package manager, process manager, etc)

  Logging into Linux
  Linux distributions will create default administrator user by default.                                                          
  Root account(administrator level) is unlimited privileges.                                                                      
  Login can happen through console, GUI or ssh.                                                                                   
  Users that are a member of the group wheel(redhat), or sudo(ubuntu) can use sudo to run commands with admin privileges.

  Using Commands
  Linux is case sensitive                                           
  -- used for long options, - for short options                       

  Targets
  Desktop, Servers, Phones, IoT

  Internals
  Motherboards comes with mini OS, which is hardcoded in H/W called BIOS (Basic input output System) /
  UEFI (Unified extensible firmware interface)
  - Survey what are the h/w devices connected and available                                                                       
  - Search for storage device with MBR (master boot record) and then mounted                                                      
  - Bootloader( GRUB) grand unified boot loader executed and load the Linux kernel into memory                                    
  - OS will run in different modes/runlevel (0,1,2,3, corresponds to rescue, single user, multi-user with GUI etc…)               

  File System
  /         Root directory
  /bin      binary files for system commands
  /sbin     binary files for system commands in multi user sessions 
  /boot     Linux images and boot configuration files
  /dev      pseudo files representing devices
  /etc      configuration files for all softwares
  /home     owners of user accounts can store their private files
  /lib      software library components/dependencies
  /root     root user files
  /usr      additional libraries, program files
  /var      Updating files : logs, application data, cache
  /proc     files representing running system processes
  /sys      representing system resources
