<h3>Linux</h3>
Linux is everywhere, cloud, smart phones, airplanes, smart TV, Gadgets, etc..
Open Source:
Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights
to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.
developed in a collaborative, public manner

Linux is a Free, Open Source, OS, released under GPL
Red Hat EL is built from open source components (Kernel and supporting software)
Red Hat has built infrastructure, support and suite of services that let us license their branded version of enterprise linux for production purpose.

Linux's distribution is an OS composed of Kernel, GNU tools, additional software, and a package manager.

  <h6>About</h6>
  It's between applications and hardware, manage storage, memory, files, GUI, CLI, networking, Utilities, drivers, security, users <br/>
  Linux originated from Unix, which is leading operating system in 1970 - 1990.                                         <br/>
  When Unix became commercial, the counter movement for free software foundation started, and Linux fits here.          <br/>
  Also GNU, GNU is a free and open-source operating system, the mission is to use free tools for Unix. <br/>
  In 1992, Linus Torvalds added Linux kernel to GNU, that completes GNU system. <br/>

  <h6>Distributions</h6>
  Debian - Ubuntu, Mint, Kali <br/>
  Redhat - CentOS, Fedora <br/>
  SUSE - OpenSUSE <br/>
  Arch Linux - LinHES, Manjaro <br/>

  <h6>Layers of Linux</h6>
  Kernel - Handles system hardware resources on behalf of the OS user. (using libraries in glibc) <br/>
  ○ User interacts with kernel/glibc using shell. <br/>
  ○ Services interacts with kernel/glibc using systemd <br/>
  Desktop - Software designed to manage GUI <br/>
  Custom Tools - provided by specific Linux distribution (package manager, process manager, etc) <br/>

  <h6>Logging into Linux</h6>
  Linux distributions will create default administrator user by default.     <br/>
  Root account(administrator level) is unlimited privileges.             <br/>
  Login can happen through console, GUI or ssh.                        <br/>
  Users that are a member of the group wheel(redhat), or sudo(ubuntu) can use sudo to run commands with admin privileges. <br/>
  Linux is case-sensitive -- used for long options, - for short options    <br/>

  <h6>Targets</h6>
  Desktop, Servers, Phones, IoT <br/>

  <h6>Internals</h6>
  Motherboards comes with mini OS, which is hardcoded in H/W called BIOS (Basic input output System) / <br/>
  UEFI (Unified extensible firmware interface) <br/>
  - Survey what are the h/w devices connected and available                                   <br/>
  - Search for storage device with MBR (master boot record) and then mounted                         <br/>
  - Bootloader( GRUB) grand unified boot loader executed and load the Linux kernel into memory       <br/>
  - OS will run in different modes/runlevel (0,1,2,3, corresponds to rescue, single user, multi-user with GUI etc…)   <br/>
