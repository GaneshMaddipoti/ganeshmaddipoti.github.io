<h6>Semantics</h6>
Idempotent, push type, State Data, workflow like execution                                                                                              <br/>
$terraform init - looks for configuration files in current directory, and check if they any provider plugins, if yes, it will download from public terraform registry. <br/>
It will use current directory to store state data.                                                                                                      <br/>
$terraform plan - displays the plan it's going to do before provisioning the infra/environment.                                                         <br/>
$terraform apply - provision the infra/environment.                                                                                                     <br/>
$terraform destroy - will destroy everything in target environment based on state data.                                                                 <br/>
