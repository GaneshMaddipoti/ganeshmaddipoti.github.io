  Terraform – Infrastructure as code
Tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure/environment through software to achieve consistent and predictable deployments. (Automated provisioning)

Architecture

Semantics
Idempotent, push type, State Data, workflow like execution
$terraform init - looks for configuration files in current directory, and check if they any provider plugins, if yes, it will download from public terraform registry.
It will use current directory to store state data.
$terraform plan - displays the plan it's going to do before provisioning the infra/environment.
$terraform apply - provision the infra/environment.
$terraform destroy - will destroy everything in target environment based on state data.

Modules/Entities
Provider Plugins – (AWS, Azure, GCP) - They are stored in registry.terraform.io
Data sources
Resources

Syntax
Declarative

Data types
Primitive:	String, Number, Boolean

	sensitive = true/false
}
