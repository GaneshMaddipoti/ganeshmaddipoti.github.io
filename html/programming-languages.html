<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
<p>
  <h6>Introduction</h6>
  Computer language innovation and development occurs for 2 fundamental reasons.                                        <br/>
  1). To adapt to changing environments.                                                                                <br/>
  2). To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming.                                              <br/>

  Machine Language                                                                                                      <br/>
    - Machine language is the lowest-level programming language that a computer can understand.                         <br/>
    - It is a binary code consisting of 0's and 1's that correspond to machine instructions.                            <br/>
    - Each computer architecture has its specific machine language, which is difficult to read and write.               <br/>

      32 bit instruction 000000 00001 00010 00110 00000 100000
      64 bit instruction 000000 00001 00010 00110 00000 100000 000000 00001 00010 00110 00000 100000

  Assembly Language                                                                                                     <br/>
    - Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is easier to read and write than machine language.     <br/>
    - Assembly language uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions, making it more human-readable.                <br/>
    - Assembly language programs are translated into machine language by an assembler.                                  <br/>
    <pre>
      ADD AH, BH                Add the content of the BH register into the AH register
      MOV TOTAL, 48             Transfer the value 48 in the memory variable TOTAL
    </pre>

  C                                                                                                                     <br/>
    - Its the need for structured, efficient, high level language that could replace assembly code when creating system programs. <br/>
    - C was invented and implemented by Dennis Ritchie, on DEC PDP 11 running Unix-OS,in 1970’s.                        <br/>
    - ‘C’ formally standardized in 1989 by ANSI                                                                         <br/>
    - C provides direct access to hardware, making it an ideal choice for systems programming and embedded systems development. <br/>
    <pre>
      #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
      int main() {
         printf("Hello, World!");
         return 0;
      }
    </pre>

  C++                                                                                                                   <br/>
    - With ‘c’ programming language, once a project reaches a certain size, its complexity increases and exceeds what a programmer can manage. <br/>
    - To solve this problem, a new way to program was invented, called object oriented programming(oop).                <br/>
    - Oop is a methodology that helps organize complex programs through the use of inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. <br/>
    - ‘C++’ was invented by bjarne stroustop in 1979, at Bell Labs, newjersey.                                          <br/>
    - Stroustrup initially called the language ‘c-with classes’, in 1983 the name changed to ‘C++’.                     <br/>
    - C++ extends ‘C’ by adding object oriented features.                                                               <br/>
    <pre>
      #include &lt;iostream&gt;
      int main() {
          std::cout << "Hello World!";
          return 0;
      }
    </pre>

  Java                                                                                                                  <br/>
    - Prior to java, languages are platform dependent, like C, C++ are compiled to specific machine.                   <br/>
    - In an attempt to find such a solution, Gosling and other colleagues began work on a portable, platform-independent language <br/>
      that could be used to produce code that would run on variety of cpu’s.                                            <br/>
    - Java achieves platform independent through,  generating an intermediate code /byte code.                          <br/>
    - All the devices which are having interpreter(JVM) can run the same byte code.                                     <br/>
    - Java was conceived by james gosling and his team at sun micro systems in 1991.                                    <br/>
    - This language was initially called “OAK” , but was renamed to “JAVA” in 1995.                                     <br/>
    - Java derives much of the syntax from ‘C’ and ‘C++’.                                                               <br/>
    <pre>
      public class HelloWorld {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println("Hello, World!");
          }
      }
    </pre>
