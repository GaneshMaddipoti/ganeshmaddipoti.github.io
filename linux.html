<h5>About</h5>
Between applications and hardware, Manage storage, memory, files, GUI, CLI, networking, Utilities, drivers, security, users         <br/>
Linux originated from Unix, which is leading operating system in 1970 - 1990.                                                       <br/>
When Unix became commercial, the counter movement for free software foundation started, and Linux fits here.                        <br/>
Also GNU, GNU is a free and open-source operating system, the mission is to use free tools for Unix.                                <br/>
In 1992, Linus Torvalds added Linux kernel to GNU, that completes GNU system.                                                       <br/>

<h5>Layers of Linux</h5>
Kernel - Handles system hardware resources on behalf of the OS user. (using libraries in glibc)                                     <br/>
○ User interacts with kernel/glibc using shell.                                                                                     <br/>
○ Services interacts with with kernel/glibc using systemd                                                                           <br/>
Desktop - Software designed to manage GUI                                                                                           <br/>
Custom Tools - provided by specific Linux distribution (package manager, process manager, etc)                                      <br/>

<h5>Logging into Linux</h5>
Linux distributions will create default administrator user by default.                                                          <br/>
Root account(administrator level) is unlimited privileges.                                                                      <br/>
Login can happen through console, GUI or ssh.                                                                                   <br/>
Users that are a member of the group wheel(redhat), or sudo(ubuntu) can use sudo to run commands with admin privileges.         <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Using Commands</h5>
Linux is case sensitive                                             <br/>
-- used for long options, - for short options                       <br/>
</p>
<p>
<h5>Targets</h5>
Desktop, Servers, Phones, IoT
</p>
<p>
<h5>Internals</h5>
Motherboards comes with mini OS, which is hardcoded in H/W called BIOS (Basic input output System) / UEFI (Unified extensible firmware interface) <br/>
- Survey what are the h/w devices connected and available                                                                       <br/>
- Search for storage device with MBR (master boot record) and then mounted                                                      <br/>
- Bootloader( GRUB) grand unified boot loader executed and load the Linux kernel into memory                                    <br/>
- OS will run in different modes/runlevel (0,1,2,3, corresponds to rescue, single user, multi-user with GUI etc…)               <br/>
