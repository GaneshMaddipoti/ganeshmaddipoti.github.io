  Python is a modern high-level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum in the 1990s.

  Do well
  Its cross-platform, interpreted, open source.
  Its easy to use (Dynamically typed, abstracted, indented)
  Its used for rapid application development (as coding time is very less compared to others)
  Its expressive (A single line will do more things)
  Its readable (as its indented very well)
  Its batter included philosophy, meaning standard library comes with email, web, DB, GUI, etc...

  Doesn't do well
  Its speed of execution is slow (as its interpreted after semi-compiled)
  It doesn't have the most of the libraries.
  It doesn't check variable type at compile time, leads to runtime errors.

  Built-in data types : Integers, Floats, Complex numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and File Objects.
  These can be manipulated using language operators, builtin functions, library functions, and data type's own methods.
  Programmers also can create their own classes and instantiate objects.
  All python objects are instances of one class or the other.
  if-elseif-else - conditional loop and for, while -> iterative loops.
  It allows function definition with flexible argument-passing options.
  Exceptions(errors) can be raised using raise statement, and handled by try-except-else construct.
  Variables dont have to be declared, can have any build-in data type, user defined object, function or module.
  We can use \ to break a long statement across multiple lines.

  Built-in Data types
    Numbers
      Integers            - -999999999 0 +999999999999
      Floats              - -9.99   0.0    +9.9
      Complex numbers     - 3+2j    -4.2-6.3j
      Booleans            - True(1) False(0)
    We can manipulate them using arithmetic operators. (+, -, *, /, **, %)
    Division of integers with single /, will result float, with // will result truncated integer.
    Note that, integers are of unlimited size, they will grow as large as you need them do.
    Complex numbers consist of both real and imaginary elements, we can get by using x.real.

    Lists
    A list can contain a mixture of other types as elements (Numbers, Strings,  Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and File objects)
    Ex: [1,2,"three", 3L, 4.0, ["a", "b"], (5,6)]
    Lists can be indexed from its front(0 to length-1) or back(-1 to -length).
    We can obtain a slice using [m:n] where m is the inclusive starting index and n is exclusive ending index.
    The size of the list increases or decreases, if the new slice is bigger or smaller than the slice its replacing.
    The operators +, * will create new list, leaving the original unchanged.

    Tuples
    The are like lists, except they are immutable.
    Can contain a mixture of other types as elements (Numbers, Strings,  Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and File objects)
    Ex: (1,2,"three", 3L, 4.0, ["a", "b"], (5,6))
    A one element needs a comma.

    Strings
    String are sequence of characters, delimited by ', ", """, ''' quotations and can contain \t and \n characters.
    Strings are immutable.
    re module provides regular expression functionality, have pattern extraction and replacement capability.

    Dictionaries
    It like associative array functionality, implemented using hash tables.
    Ex: {1: "one", 2: "tow", 3: "three"}
    Keys must be an immutable type.
    Values can be any kind of objects including mutable objects lists, and dictionaries.

    Sets
    Its an unordered collection of objects with membership, uniqueness in its features.

    File Objects
    A file in system, is accessed by file object in Python.
    The os module provides number of functions over files and directories in that system.

  Operators
    Arithmetic  : +, -, *, /, //, **, %
    Comparison  : <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, is, is not, in, not in    results boolean
    Logical     : and, not, or                                    results boolean

  Statements
    if: elseif: else:     conditional statement
    while: for:           iterative statement

  Functions
    Functions are defined by using the def statement.
    The return statement is what a function uses to return a value.
    The return type can be of any type.
    If no return statement is encountered, python's None value is returned.
    Function arguments can be entered either by position or name.
    Function parameters can be defined with defaults.
    A special parameter can be defined to collect all extra arguments into a tuple, or dictionary.

  Exceptions
    Exceptions(errors) can be raised, caght, and handled by try-except-finally-else compound statement.

  Modules and Packages
    Modules is used to define functions at one place and use them in multiple places
    Group of modules, we organize them using packages, subpackages.

    Classes are defined using Class keyword.
    The instance initializer method or constructor is defined as __init__ method, and will be called implicitly.
    The first argument of any method is by convention called self.
    The print method implicitly uses __str__ method.
