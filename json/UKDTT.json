Plan for a 15-minute break every two hours. If you feel sleepy, stop in a safe place. \nEyesight: You MUST be able to read a vehicle number plate from 20 metres. If you need glasses or contact lenses to do this, you MUST wear them at all times while driving. \n\nAlcohol &amp; Drugs:\nYou MUST NOT drive if you are over the legal alcohol limit.  In England and Wales, the limit is 35 microgrammes per 100ml of breath. In Scotland, it is 22 microgrammes. \nYou MUST NOT drive under the influence of drugs or medicine. This includes illegal drugs and certain medicines that may impair your driving.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Vehicle Condition and Documents (Rules 89, 97 &amp; Annexes)</b></div><div>You MUST ensure your vehicle is roadworthy and complies with all regulations. This includes having working lights, brakes, steering, and tyres with the correct tread depth (a minimum of 1.6mm for cars).</div><div><br></div><div><b>Documents:\n</b>Licence: You MUST hold a valid licence for the vehicle you are driving. \nInsurance: You MUST NOT drive a vehicle without at least third-party insurance. \nMOT: Your vehicle MUST have a valid MOT certificate if it is required.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Signals (Rules 103-112)\n</b>You should give clear signals in good time before you change direction, stop, or move off. \nMake sure your signals are not confusing to others and cancel them after use. \nYou MUST obey signals given by police officers, traffic officers, and traffic wardens. \nThe horn MUST NOT be used aggressively or when stationary on the road. </div><div>It MUST NOT be used in a built-up area between 11:30 pm and 7:00 am, except when another road user poses a danger. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Speed and Stopping Distances (Rules 124-126)\n</b>Speed Limits: You MUST NOT exceed the maximum speed limit for the road and your vehicle. For cars on a road with street lighting (unless otherwise signed), the limit is generally 30 mph. \n\nStopping Distances: </div><div>Always drive at a speed that allows you to stop well within the distance you can see to be clear. \nMaintain at least a two-second gap between you and the vehicle in front on fast-moving roads. \nThis gap should be at least doubled on wet roads and increased further on icy roads. Stopping distances can be ten times greater in icy conditions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Lines and Lane Markings (Rules 127-132)\n</b><br></div><div>Double White Lines: Where the line nearest to you is solid, you MUST NOT cross or straddle it, with limited exceptions (e.g., to pass a cyclist travelling at 10 mph or less, or to enter an adjoining property, if safe). \n\nReflective Studs:\nRed: Mark the left edge of the road. \nAmber: Mark the central reservation of a dual carriageway or motorway. \nWhite: Mark lanes or the middle of the road. \nGreen: Mark the edge of the main carriageway at lay-bys and slip roads.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Mobile Phones and Distractions (Rules 148-150)</b></div><div>You MUST NOT use a hand-held mobile phone or similar device for any purpose while driving or supervising a learner. This applies even when stationary in traffic. \nExceptions exist for calling 999 or 112 in a genuine emergency where it is unsafe to stop, or for making a contactless payment at a terminal while the vehicle is stationary. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Overtaking (Rules 162-169)\n</b>Overtake only when it is safe and legal to do so. \nGive vulnerable road users like motorcyclists, cyclists, and horse riders at least as much room as you would a car. As a guide, leave at least 1.5 metres when overtaking cyclists. \nYou MUST NOT overtake if it involves crossing a solid white line on your side of the road, or near a pedestrian crossing. \n\n<b>Junctions (Rules 170-183)\n</b>STOP Signs: At a junction with a 'Stop' sign and a solid white line, you MUST stop behind the line and wait for a safe gap. \nGIVE WAY Signs: You MUST give way to traffic on the main road. \nBox Junctions: You MUST NOT enter a yellow box junction until your exit road or lane is clear. The only exception is when you want to turn right and are only stopped by oncoming traffic or other vehicles also waiting to turn right. \n\n<b>Roundabouts (Rules 184-190)\n</b>On approaching, you should give priority to traffic coming from your right, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise. \nGive plenty of room to cyclists and horse riders. Do not attempt to overtake them within their lane on the roundabout. \nAt mini-roundabouts, all vehicles \nMUST pass around the central markings, except for large vehicles that are physically unable to. \n\n<b>Pedestrian Crossings (Rules 191-199)\n</b>You MUST NOT park on a crossing or on the zig-zag lines. \nZebra Crossings: You MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto the crossing. You should give way if they are waiting to cross. \nPelican Crossings: These have a flashing amber light. When it is flashing, you MUST give way to any pedestrians on the crossing. If it is clear, you may proceed. \nPuffin and Toucan Crossings: These do not have a flashing amber phase and use a standard red-amber-green light sequence. \n\n<b>Parking (Rules 238-252)\n</b>You MUST NOT wait or park on yellow lines during their hours of operation. Double yellow lines mean no waiting at any time. \nYou MUST NOT park facing against the traffic flow at night. \nWhen opening your door, you should use the hand on the opposite side (e.g., left hand for the driver's door). This makes you turn your head and helps you see approaching cyclists or traffic. \nIn London and Scotland, you MUST NOT park on the pavement, with limited exceptions. Elsewhere, you should not do so unless signs permit it. \n\n<b>Motorways (Rules 253-274)\n</b>Prohibited Users: Motorways MUST NOT be used by pedestrians, learner drivers (unless with an approved instructor in a dual-controlled car), motorcycles under 50cc, cyclists, or certain slow-moving vehicles. \nJoining: Give priority to traffic already on the motorway and match your speed to fit into a safe gap in the left-hand lane. \nLane Discipline: Keep to the left lane unless overtaking. \nOvertaking: Overtake only on the right. Do not overtake on the left. \nStopping: You MUST NOT stop on the carriageway, hard shoulder, or slip road except in an emergency. \nSignals: A red 'X' on a sign above a lane indicates the lane is closed. You \nMUST NOT drive in a closed lane. \n\n<b>Penalties (Annex 5)\n</b>Points System: Accumulating 12 or more penalty points within a 3-year period MUST result in disqualification for at least 6 months. \nNew Drivers: If you get 6 or more penalty points within two years of passing your first driving test, your licence will be revoked. You will have to reapply for a provisional licence and pass both the theory and practical tests again.</div><div><br></div>","x":9,"y":46,"width":1113,"height":991.96875,"bgColor":"wheat"}],"x":226,"y":743,"width":1132.96875,"height":1057.96875,"bgColor":"#F0F0F0"},{"id":"Container-1759590973155","elements":[{"id":"Text-1759590977884","text":"Order

Stopping distances can be ten times greater in icy conditions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Lines and Lane Markings (Rules 127-132)\n</b><br></div><div>Double White Lines: Where the line nearest to you is solid, you MUST NOT cross or straddle it, with limited exceptions (e.g., to pass a cyclist travelling at 10 mph or less, or to enter an adjoining property, if safe). \n\nReflective Studs:\nRed: Mark the left edge of the road. \nAmber: Mark the central reservation of a dual carriageway or motorway. \nWhite: Mark lanes or the middle of the road. \nGreen: Mark the edge of the main carriageway at lay-bys and slip roads.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Mobile Phones and Distractions (Rules 148-150)</b></div><div>You MUST NOT use a hand-held mobile phone or similar device for any purpose while driving or supervising a learner. This applies even when stationary in traffic. \nExceptions exist for calling 999 or 112 in a genuine emergency where it is unsafe to stop, or for making a contactless payment at a terminal while the vehicle is stationary. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Overtaking (Rules 162-169)\n</b>Overtake only when it is safe and legal to do so. \nGive vulnerable road users like motorcyclists, cyclists, and horse riders at least as much room as you would a car. As a guide, leave at least 1.5 metres when overtaking cyclists. \nYou MUST NOT overtake if it involves crossing a solid white line on your side of the road, or near a pedestrian crossing. \n\n<b>Junctions (Rules 170-183)\n</b>STOP Signs: At a junction with a 'Stop' sign and a solid white line, you MUST stop behind the line and wait for a safe gap. \nGIVE WAY Signs: You MUST give way to traffic on the main road. \nBox Junctions: You MUST NOT enter a yellow box junction until your exit road or lane is clear. The only exception is when you want to turn right and are only stopped by oncoming traffic or other vehicles also waiting to turn right. \n\n<b>Roundabouts (Rules 184-190)\n</b>On approaching, you should give priority to traffic coming from your right, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise. \nGive plenty of room to cyclists and horse riders. Do not attempt to overtake them within their lane on the roundabout. \nAt mini-roundabouts, all vehicles \nMUST pass around the central markings, except for large vehicles that are physically unable to. \n\n<b>Pedestrian Crossings (Rules 191-199)\n</b>You MUST NOT park on a crossing or on the zig-zag lines. \nZebra Crossings: You MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto the crossing. You should give way if they are waiting to cross. \nPelican Crossings: These have a flashing amber light. When it is flashing, you MUST give way to any pedestrians on the crossing. If it is clear, you may proceed. \nPuffin and Toucan Crossings: These do not have a flashing amber phase and use a standard red-amber-green light sequence. \n\n<b>Parking (Rules 238-252)\n</b>You MUST NOT wait or park on yellow lines during their hours of operation. Double yellow lines mean no waiting at any time. \nYou MUST NOT park facing against the traffic flow at night. \nWhen opening your door, you should use the hand on the opposite side (e.g., left hand for the driver's door). This makes you turn your head and helps you see approaching cyclists or traffic. \nIn London and Scotland, you MUST NOT park on the pavement, with limited exceptions. Elsewhere, you should not do so unless signs permit it. \n\n<b>Motorways (Rules 253-274)\n</b>Prohibited Users: Motorways MUST NOT be used by pedestrians, learner drivers (unless with an approved instructor in a dual-controlled car), motorcycles under 50cc, cyclists, or certain slow-moving vehicles. \nJoining: Give priority to traffic already on the motorway and match your speed to fit into a safe gap in the left-hand lane. \nLane Discipline: Keep to the left lane unless overtaking. \nOvertaking: Overtake only on the right. Do not overtake on the left. \nStopping: You MUST NOT stop on the carriageway, hard shoulder, or slip road except in an emergency. \nSignals: A red 'X' on a sign above a lane indicates the lane is closed. You \nMUST NOT drive in a closed lane. \n\n<b>Penalties (Annex 5)\n</b>Points System: Accumulating 12 or more penalty points within a 3-year period MUST result in disqualification for at least 6 months. \nNew Drivers: If you get 6 or more penalty points within two years of passing your first driving test, your licence will be revoked. You will have to reapply for a provisional licence and pass both the theory and practical tests again.</div><div><br></div>","x":9,"y":46,"width":1113,"height":991.96875,"bgColor":"wheat"}],"x":226,"y":743,"width":1132.96875,"height":1057.96875,"bgColor":"#F0F0F0"},{"id":"Container-1759590973155","elements":[{"id":"Text-1759590977884","text":"Order
