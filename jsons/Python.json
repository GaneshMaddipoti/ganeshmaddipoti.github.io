The \"What is Python?\" (The Technical Definition)\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.\nHigh-level: It uses English-like syntax, making it easy for humans to read.\nInterpreted: Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging faster.\nGeneral-purpose: You can use it for almost anything—from web development to data science.\n\n2. Why Choose Python? (The Selling Points)\nReadability: Python’s motto is \"readability counts.\" It uses indentation instead of curly braces, resulting in clean, uncluttered code.\nMassive Library Support: Whether you want to build an AI (TensorFlow), analyze data (Pandas), or build a website (Django), there is already a \"package\" ready for you.\nThe Community: Being one of the most popular languages in the world means if you run into a bug, someone has already fixed it on Stack Overflow.\n\n3. Real-World Applications\nArtificial Intelligence: The backbone of ChatGPT and self-driving cars.\nData Science: Used by NASA to analyze planetary data and by Netflix to recommend movies.\nAutomation: Writing \"scripts\" to handle boring tasks like renaming thousands of files or scraping web data."},{"id":"node-1768913159687","position":{"x":530.3528442382812,"y":879.6519165039062},"size":{"width":875.2855224609375,"height":412.027099609375},"type":"Container","title":"How Program Runs","children":[{"id":"node-1768913210657","position":{"x":630.66357421875,"y":191.95005798339844},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"RAM","iconPath":"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/157926/ram-memory.svg"},{"id":"node-1768913223966","position":{"x":1365.5771484375,"y":215.2054443359375},"size":{"width":326.70166015625,"height":254.7608642578125},"type":"Container","title":"Processor","iconPath":"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/487691/processor.svg"},{"id":"path-1768913414120","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768913210657","endElement":"node-1768913223966"}]},{"id":"node-1768913183477","position":{"x":603.7928466796875,"y":1060.2440185546875},"size":{"width":151.03857421875,"height":53.4014892578125},"type":"TextBox","title":"Source_code.py"}]}}
