The \"What is Python?\" (The Technical Definition)\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.\nHigh-level: It uses English-like syntax, making it easy for humans to read.\nInterpreted: Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging faster.\nGeneral-purpose: You can use it for almost anything—from web development to data science.\n\n2. Why Choose Python? (The Selling Points)\nReadability: Python’s motto is \"readability counts.\" It uses indentation instead of curly braces, resulting in clean, uncluttered code.\nMassive Library Support: Whether you want to build an AI (TensorFlow), analyze data (Pandas), or build a website (Django), there is already a \"package\" ready for you.\nThe Community: Being one of the most popular languages in the world means if you run into a bug, someone has already fixed it on Stack Overflow.\n\n3. Real-World Applications\nArtificial Intelligence: The backbone of ChatGPT and self-driving cars.\nData Science: Used by NASA to analyze planetary data and by Netflix to recommend movies.\nAutomation: Writing \"scripts\" to handle boring tasks like renaming thousands of files or scraping web data."},{"id":"node-1768913159687","position":{"x":530.3528442382812,"y":879.8171997070312},"size":{"width":880.3956298828125,"height":280.867431640625},"type":"Container","title":"How Program Runs","children":[{"id":"node-1768913210657","position":{"x":632.57568359375,"y":128.85084533691406},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"RAM","iconPath":"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/157926/ram-memory.svg","children":[{"id":"node-1768914377953","position":{"x":40.031272888183594,"y":54.51764678955078},"size":{"width":802.1824645996094,"height":399.3335266113281},"type":"Container","title":"Python Interpreter","pan":{"x":-185.86562891033407,"y":48.35345006919894,"scale":0.6457339845000003},"children":[{"id":"node-1768914412008","position":{"x":-154.62246990203857,"y":261.03460693359375},"size":{"width":210,"height":100},"type":"TextBox","title":"Compiler"},{"id":"node-1768914413875","position":{"x":153.60528564453125,"y":264.5474548339844},"size":{"width":210,"height":100},"type":"TextBox","title":"Bytecode"},{"id":"node-1768914435863","position":{"x":509.5948486328125,"y":172.61769104003906},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"Python Virtual Machine"},{"id":"path-1768914467887","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768914412008","endElement":"node-1768914413875"},{"id":"path-1768914469371","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768914413875","endElement":"node-1768914435863"}]}]},{"id":"node-1768913223966","position":{"x":1319.6868896484375,"y":163.57882690429688},"size":{"width":326.70166015625,"height":254.7608642578125},"type":"Container","title":"Processor","iconPath":"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/487691/processor.svg"},{"id":"path-1768913414120","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768913210657","endElement":"node-1768913223966"},{"id":"node-1768913917697","position":{"x":71.20366287231445,"y":180.48094177246094},"size":{"width":347.3007507324219,"height":184.770751953125},"type":"Container","title":"Virtual Environment","pan":{"x":2,"y":-2},"children":[{"id":"node-1768913954752","position":{"x":382.87851333618164,"y":34.65104675292969},"size":{"width":308.2056579589844,"height":144.7648468017578},"type":"CodeBox","content":"# Workflow\n# Python comes with a built-in tool called venv. \n# 1)Create the environment\npython -m venv .venv\n#This creates a folder (usually named .venv) that holds the isolated Python files.\n# 2)activate the environment: \nsource .venv/bin/activate\n# 3)install packages: \npip install requests\n# Now, any package you install stays inside that folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"node-1768914685442","position":{"x":-2.0725202560424805,"y":15.545387268066406},"size":{"width":353.63352966308594,"height":320.83546447753906},"type":"TextBox","title":"About","content":"A Virtual Environment is an isolated folder on your computer that contains its own specific version of Python and its own set of installed libraries.\n\nWhy Do We Need Them?\nAvoid Version Conflicts: Project A might need Django 3.0, while Project B needs Django 5.0.

Indentation (The Most Important Rule)\nIn most languages (Java, C++), you use curly braces {} to show which code belongs to a function or loop. \nIn Python, we use spaces.\nStandard practice is 4 spaces per level.\nIf your indentation is wrong, Python will throw an IndentationError.\n\nB. Case Sensitivity\nPython is case-sensitive. This means Variable, variable, and VARIABLE are three completely different things to Python.\n\nC. Comments\nUse the hash symbol (#) for single-line comments. Comments are ignored by the interpreter and are used to explain the \"why\" behind your code.\nPython\n# This is a comment - the computer ignores this\nx = 10  # You can also put comments at the end of a line\n\nD. Colons (:)\nIn Python, a colon marks the beginning of a new \"block\" of code (like an if statement, a for loop, or a function definition). The line following a colon must be indented."}]}]}]}}
