The \"What is Python?\" (The Technical Definition)\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.\nHigh-level: It uses English-like syntax, making it easy for humans to read.\nInterpreted: Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging faster.\nGeneral-purpose: You can use it for almost anything—from web development to data science.\n\n2. Why Choose Python? (The Selling Points)\nReadability: Python’s motto is \"readability counts.\" It uses indentation instead of curly braces, resulting in clean, uncluttered code.\nMassive Library Support: Whether you want to build an AI (TensorFlow), analyze data (Pandas), or build a website (Django), there is already a \"package\" ready for you.\nThe Community: Being one of the most popular languages in the world means if you run into a bug, someone has already fixed it on Stack Overflow.\n\n3. Real-World Applications\nArtificial Intelligence: The backbone of ChatGPT and self-driving cars.\nData Science: Used by NASA to analyze planetary data and by Netflix to recommend movies.\nAutomation: Writing \"scripts\" to handle boring tasks like renaming thousands of files or scraping web data.","children":[{"id":"node-1768989302253-562","position":{"x":230.25177001953125,"y":105.35969543457031},"size":{"width":2969.3216552734375,"height":1653.4426574707031},"type":"Container","title":"System","pan":{"x":257.93230587233086,"y":12.172526523498107,"scale":1.178973845500001},"children":[{"id":"node-1768989302253-425","position":{"x":1957.0785522460938,"y":231.1183319091797},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"RAM","iconPath":"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/157926/ram-memory.svg","children":[{"id":"node-1768989302253-505","position":{"x":40.031272888183594,"y":54.51764678955078},"size":{"width":802.1824645996094,"height":399.3335266113281},"type":"Container","title":"Python Interpreter","pan":{"x":-185.86562891033407,"y":48.35345006919894,"scale":0.6457339845000003},"children":[{"id":"node-1768989302253-492","position":{"x":613.1105346679688,"y":249.362060546875},"size":{"width":276.87890625,"height":125.09420776367188},"type":"Container","title":"Python Virtual Machine"},{"id":"node-1768989302253-778","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768914412008","endElement":"node-1768914413875"},{"id":"node-1768989302253-498","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768914413875","endElement":"node-1768914435863"},{"id":"node-1768998637189","position":{"x":-89.66788864135742,"y":268.1393737792969},"size":{"width":264.278018951416,"height":117.75314331054688},"type":"Container","title":"Compiler"},{"id":"node-1768998638097","position":{"x":253.7318630218506,"y":258.96771240234375},"size":{"width":268.0543518066406,"height":125.41812133789062},"type":"Container","title":"Bytecode"},{"id":"path-1768998731082","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768998637189","endElement":"node-1768998638097"},{"id":"path-1768998732489","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768998638097","endElement":"node-1768989302253-492"}]}]},{"id":"node-1768989302253-550","position":{"x":2071.356201171875,"y":782.4954528808594},"size":{"width":326.70166015625,"height":254.7608642578125},"type":"Container","title":"Processor","iconPath":"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/487691/processor.svg"},{"id":"node-1768989302253-705","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768913210657","endElement":"node-1768913223966"},{"id":"node-1768989302253-450","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768913917697","endElement":"node-1768913210657"},{"id":"node-1769420435505","position":{"x":413.3681335449219,"y":173.42190551757812},"size":{"width":1308.1852416992188,"height":933.0177612304688},"type":"Container","title":"Hard Disk","pan":{"x":-285.3692419417687,"y":-192.0738704027043,"scale":0.4001744710518617},"children":[{"id":"node-1769420454888-305135","position":{"x":-78.61029052734375,"y":380.6683883666992},"size":{"width":2274.1741943359375,"height":1403.8009033203125},"type":"Container","title":"Virtual Environment","description":"A Virtual Environment is an isolated folder on your computer that contains its own specific version of Python and its own set of installed libraries.\n\nWhy Do We Need Them?\nAvoid Version Conflicts: Project A might need Django 3.0, while Project B needs Django 5.0.
