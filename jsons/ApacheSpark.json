(Cluster computing platform)\nAt its core, Spark is a “computational engine” that is responsible for scheduling, distributing, and monitoring applications consisting of many computational tasks across many worker machines, or a computing cluster. \nIf Hadoop MapReduce was the \"first generation\" of big data processing, Spark is the \"second generation\"—built for speed, ease of use, and versatility.\n\nFeatures\nEasy to use: we can develop applications, using a high-level API that let us focus on the content of our computation\nSpeed: It is up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce because it processes data in-memory (RAM) rather than writing to the disk after every step.\nLazy Evaluation: Spark doesn't execute your code immediately. It builds a plan (called a DAG or Directed Acyclic Graph) and only runs it when you finally ask for a result. This allows it to optimize the entire process first.\nAs general engine: letting you combine multiple types of computations (e.g., SQL queries, text process‐ing, and machine learning) that might previously have required different engines.\n\nPolyglot: You can write Spark code in Python (PySpark), Scala, Java, or R."},{"id":"line-1768776347399","type":"Line","lineCoordinates":[{"x":1033.8216552734375,"y":1239.6767578125},{"x":1033.8216552734375,"y":1239.6767578125}]},{"id":"line-1768776355611","type":"Line","lineCoordinates":[{"x":1124.3660888671875,"y":1114.84912109375},{"x":1124.3660888671875,"y":1114.84912109375}]},{"id":"node-1768776778906","position":{"x":489.4761047363281,"y":238.01023864746094},"size":{"width":206.75299072265625,"height":47.46754455566406},"type":"TitleBox","content":"Apache Spark"},{"id":"node-1768777090579","position":{"x":502.0453186035156,"y":815.4525756835938},"size":{"width":1274.9583129882812,"height":738.1610107421875},"type":"Container","title":"Architecture","pan":{"x":38,"y":258},"children":[{"id":"node-1768777131082","position":{"x":119.09141540527344,"y":773.4568481445312},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"Client"},{"id":"node-1768777133224","position":{"x":958.9923095703125,"y":771.3358764648438},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"Cluster Manager"},{"id":"node-1768777134492","position":{"x":1919.95947265625,"y":258.4476318359375},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"Worker Node"},{"id":"node-1768777135433","position":{"x":1918.7593994140625,"y":762.5949096679688},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"Worker Node"},{"id":"node-1768777136358","position":{"x":1963.299560546875,"y":1301.5347900390625},"size":{"width":450,"height":300},"type":"Container","title":"Worker Node"},{"id":"path-1768777149657","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768777131082","endElement":"node-1768777133224"},{"id":"path-1768777151820","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768777133224","endElement":"node-1768777134492"},{"id":"path-1768777155157","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768777133224","endElement":"node-1768777135433"},{"id":"path-1768777156727","type":"Path","startElement":"node-1768777133224","endElement":"node-1768777136358"}]}]}}
