Functional programming is a way of writing code more declaratively.
FP uses lambda expression to write code.
Lambda expression is a block of code that gets passed around.
Ex: a -> {a.canHop()}
@FunctionalInterface annotation tells the compiler we intend the interface should have SAM(Single abstract method)
